# Attention Based Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder-Decoder for Generative Context-Aware Query Suggestion
For search engines to be able to formulate adequate query suggestions, it is essential to bear in mind the usersâ€™ search intent and to be aware of the context. [Sordoni et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02221) proposed a Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder-Decoder architecture to suggest queries using the previous queries as context. This is an extension using an attention mechanism. The implementation is in Tensorflow. Sordoni et al. implementation in Theano can be found [here.](https://github.com/sordonia/hred-qs)

# Data
The data set used is the AOL data set which is composed of query searches from 1st of March 2006 to 31st May 2006. The data set has been pre-processed as the original authors did. Data used to train can be downloaded [here.](https://goo.gl/vL1LDX)
